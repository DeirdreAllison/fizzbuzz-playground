fizzbuzz-playground
===================

I knew that I wanted to do and if/else statement using %. I also referred to the following sources for ideas for how
to write it:

http://rubyquiz.com/quiz126.html
and also this for reminders on ruby syntax:

I knew I wanted to use the format I showed because while not the shortest, I feel that it's straightforward and easy
to understand and also similar to the approach that would be used in JavaScript so it seemed like a solid
approach for many programming languages.
