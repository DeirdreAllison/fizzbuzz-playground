FizzBuzz Playground
===================

I knew that I wanted to do and if/else statement using %. I also referred to the following sources for ideas for how
to write it:<br>
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21666030/fizz-buzz-in-ruby-for-dummies<br>
http://rubyquiz.com/quiz126.html<br>
and also this for reminders on ruby syntax:<br>
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_classes.htm<br>

I knew I wanted to use the format I showed because while not the shortest, I feel that it's straightforward and easy
to understand and also similar to the approach that would be used in JavaScript so it seemed like a solid
approach for many programming languages.
